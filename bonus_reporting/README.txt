Bonus Reporting Pipeline Overview:

The pipeline is run from bonus_pipeline.py via the function run_bonus. As an argument, pass the name of the experiment
for which you wish to generate bonus reports. You may additionally pass a list of subject IDs using the keyword argument
"subjects," in order to manually define which participants will have their reports generated. If you do not pass a list
of subjects, the pipeline will be run on any subjects listed in /data/eeg/scalp/ltp/<exp_name>/recently_modified.json,
which is generated by identify_modify_participants.py in the top-level scalp_lab_reporting directory. By default, the
pipeline will calculate bonuses, generate bonus reports in TSV and PDF format, then upload the PDFs to the lab webserver
at memory.psych.upenn.edu:/var/www/html/ltp_reports/<exp_name>_Bonus/. You can specify not to upload the reports by
setting the keyword argument "upload" to False.

The bonus calculations themselves are defined in calculation/bonus_<exp_name>.py, and the code to generate reports are
defined in reports/bonus_report_<exp_name>.py.

New experiments can be added to the pipeline by creating bonus_<exp_name>.py and bonus_report_<exp_name>.py files for
the new experiment(s) and adding conditional calls to these scripts within the main run_bonus function of
bonus_pipeline.py.
